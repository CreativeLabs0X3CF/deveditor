As of August 2007, the project is no longer active. Work will be resumed sometime in the future.

# PEditor #
PEditor is an experimental programmer's editor. The goal is to create an editor that could be used by a person (most likely a student) with no a priori knowledge of programming. This aims to be a classic "write code, click run" IDE.

By version 1.0, it should support
  * tabs (done)
  * syntax highlighting (done)
  * some form of auto-complete
  * ability to compile/run simple programmes (done)
  * a code snippets library

This is aimed at the C/C++ programmer, though support for other languages may be added.
